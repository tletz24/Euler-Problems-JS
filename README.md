# Euler Problems Repo
## Summary
This repository is intended for me to be a place where I can write & push my solution to some some of the Euler problems.

## Getting Setup
Download & Install ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)) or (and this is preferable) Setup your Node Environment with [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

Once you have those you can clone the repo:
`git clone https://github.com/tletz24/Euler-Problems-JS.gi)`

You can then run each problem as so:
`node One.js`
