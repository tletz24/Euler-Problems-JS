# Euler Problems

## Summary

This repository is intended for me to be a place where I can write & push my solution to some some of the Euler problems.

## Getting Setup

Download & Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) or (and this is preferable) Setup your Node Environment with [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

Once you have those you can clone the repo:
`git clone https://github.com/tletz24/Euler-Problems-JS.git`

You can then run each problem as so:
`node One.js`

## Developing

New problems can be solved in a single `.js` file in the [Problems](Problems/) directory.
It is a pretty easy naming convention üòÅ

If you believe that you can utilize some functions else where, feel free to put them in
the [Utils](Utils/) directory, but try to **keep it simple**
